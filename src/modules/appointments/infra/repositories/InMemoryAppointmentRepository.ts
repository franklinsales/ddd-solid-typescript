/* Concept Focus
* Purpose:
*  - Implements the domain repository interface, IAppointmentRepository.
*  - Stores everything in memory (array) for fast prototyping and testing. (This is not a real application)
*/

/* DDD:
* - This class belongs in the infrastructure Layer.
* - Implements the repository defined by the domain, but never lives inside the domain itsel.
* - Easy to swap with a real DB adapter or between DBs (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma, etc.) later â€” without changing domain logic.
*/

/* SOLID:
* - SRP: Only stores and retrieves Appointment entities.
* - DIP: Fulfills an interface defined in the domain, not the other way around.
